# 🧠 PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. Early prediction can help prevent fatal incidents. This project builds a machine learning model to classify whether an individual is at risk of a heart attack based on various health indicators.

- Heart Rate: Heart rate of the patient.

- Diabetes: Whether the patient has diabetes (Yes/No).

- Family History: Family history of heart-related problems (1: Yes, 0: No).

- Smoking: Smoking status of the patient (1: Smoker, 0: Non-smoker).

- Obesity: Obesity status of the patient (1: Obese, 0: Not obese).

- Alcohol Consumption: Level of alcohol consumption by the patient (None/Light/Moderate/Heavy).

- Exercise Hours Per Week: Number of exercise hours per week.

- Diet: Dietary habits of the patient (Healthy/Average/Unhealthy).

- Previous Heart Problems: Previous heart problems of the patient (1: Yes, 0: No).

- Medication Use: Medication usage by the patient (1: Yes, 0: No).

- Stress Level: Stress level reported by the patient (1-10).

- Sedentary Hours Per Day: Hours of sedentary activity per day.

- Income: Income level of the patient.

- BMI: Body Mass Index (BMI) of the patient.

- Triglycerides: Triglyceride levels of the patient.

- Physical Activity Days Per Week: Days of physical activity per week.

- Sleep Hours Per Day: Hours of sleep per day.

- Country: Country of the patient.

- Continent: Continent where the patient resides.

- Hemisphere: Hemisphere where the patient resides.

- Heart Attack Risk (Outcome): Presence of heart attack risk (1: Yes, 0: No).

# 🧼 DATA PREPROCESSING 

- Handled missing values  
- Applied feature scaling (`StandardScaler`)  
- Removed irrelevant features (e.g., `Patient ID`, `Hemisphere`, `Continent`, `Blood Pressure`)  
-----

# 📊 DATA VISUALIZATIONS 
- KDE plots, boxplots, histograms  
- Correlation matrix heatmap  
- Count plots for categorical features 

-----

# 📊 EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)
- Distribution analysis (Age, Cholesterol, BMI, etc.)  
- Correlation heatmap to identify relationships  
- Outlier detection (boxplots)  
- Class distribution  

---

# ⚙️ FEATURE ENGINEERING 
Created interaction and ratio-based features to enhance model performance:
- `BMI_Stress` = BMI × Stress Level  
- `Activity_Ratio` = Exercise Hours per Week / (Sedentary Hours Per Day + 1)  
- `BP_Product` = Systolic_BP × Diastolic_BP  
- `Sleep_Stress_Interaction`  = Sleep Hours Per Day × Stress Level
- `Substance_Use` = Smoking * Alcohol Consumption
- `Diastolic_BP`
- `Systolic_BP`

# 📈 RESULTS & OBSERVATIONS 

After training and tuning  multiple Machine learning models with various feature selection methods, here are the top results:

| Feature Selection | Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall  | F1 Score |
|------------------|---------------------|----------|-----------|---------|----------|
| L1_Lasso         | Logistic Regression | 0.692889 | 0.800554  | 0.513778 | 0.625880 |
| Mutual_Info      | XGBoost             | 0.644889 | 0.647378  | 0.636444 | 0.641865 |
| SelectKBest      | CatBoost            | 0.640289 | 0.679502  | 0.533333 | 0.597610 |
| RandomForest-Importance | XGBoost | 0.628000 | 0.613386 | 0.692444 | 0.650522

# 📌 KEY OBSERVATIONS:

- *Logistic Regression + L1_Lasso* gave the best F1 Score, showing balanced performance between precision and recall.
- *XGBoost + Mutual_Info* had the best recall and strong overall balance, making it ideal where reducing false negatives is critical.
- *CatBoost + SelectKBest* showed the highest precision, which is useful when false positives need to be minimized.
